fei is a class created by graduate students and LaTeX enthusiasts that allow students from FEI University Center to create their academic works, be it a monograph, masters dissertation or phd thesis, under the typographic rules of the institution. The class makes it possible to create a full academic work, supporting functionalities such as cover, title page, catalog entry, dedication, summary, lists of figures, tables, algorithms, acronyms and symbols, multiple authors, index, references, appendices and attachments.

fei is loosely based in the Brazilian National Standards Organization (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas, ABNT) standards for the creation of academic works, such as ABNT NBR 10520:2002 (Citations) and ABNT NBR 6023:2002 (Bibligraphic References).

In the manual, users will find detailed information regarding the class commands, environments and best practices to create an academic text of good quality. We also made available a few template files which students may use as a starting point for their texts.
