A new organizing principle--the representational dimension of atomic, factored, and structured models--has been added. Significant new material has been provided in areas such as partially observable search, contingency planning, hierarchical planning, relational and first-order probability models, regularization and loss functions in machine learning, kernel methods, Web search engines, information extraction, and learning in vision and robotics. The book also includes hundreds of new exercises.},
